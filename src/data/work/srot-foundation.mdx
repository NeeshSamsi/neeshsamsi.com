<H2>The Client</H2>

This was actually a unique project in that I approached the Srot Foundation and offered to build them a website. I have known one of the directors, Parth Phalke for a couple of years studying under him in an alternative education institution, Sahyadri School, KFI. His passion for education and connecting with students brought him to Himachal in his initiative for Rural Education.

Admittedly, they did have a Wordpress website. However it wasn't fully fleshed out and unfortunately shortly after I reached out, the wordpress setup was hacked and the site went down.

<H2>The Challenge</H2>

- Apart from social media, having a web presence is essential to organisations to provide additional credibility.
- Receiving funding was a tedious process involving sending complete bank details and going back and forth regarding details like PAN No, etc.
- It was not easy to access information about volunteering and conducting workshops and how to apply.
- The website also acts as a repository of previous and upcoming activities by the foundation

<H2>The Research</H2>

Research was primarily conducted through Discovery calls with the clients.

We concluded that the Primary User Goal was to support the foundation either monetarily or by volunteering and conducting workshops or interacting with the students.

The Target Audience is philanthropic individuals who feel strongly about the cause. They include individuals above the age of 35 who are willing to donate and institutions or educators who can volunteer and share their insights.

<H2>The Approach</H2>

- Text had to be laid out in short and powerful sections so they can be consumed easily. Every section is interspersed with imagery to give context.
- [Srot's story and mission](https://srot.in/story) was very important to them so it was crucial convey it effectively.
- Dedicated page for Volunteering & Workshops along with testimonials for social proof.
- Donations are streamlined through the Razorpay payments platform which allows support for custom fields such as PAN No. so that all information can be collected at once during the payment.

<H2>The Development</H2>

The website was completely custom coded. The tech stack was [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
with Typescript and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling. We used [Formspark](https://formspark.io) to handle contact form submissions and integrated
[Keystatic](https://keystatic.com/), a CMS that hooks into your local files, which gives maintainers of the site a seamless editing experience while keeping the development
side simple for me without bringing in complexities like Databases. The full source code can be found on my GitHub repo - [neeshsamsi/yogeshsamsi](https://github.com/neeshsamsi/yogeshsamsi)

<H2>The Conclusion & Final Product</H2>

After the site was published, Srot has seen a notable increase in traction through web traffic. They are also more confident in sending proposals for funding now that they have a wesite and a [donation page](https://srot.in/support).
