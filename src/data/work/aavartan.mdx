<H2>The Client</H2>

Garima Arya is a phenomenal Kathak Dancer & founder of Kalakulam Academy. The Academy hosts Aavartan, their Annual Festival for Music & Dance. They approached me to design some assets for the event.

<H2>The Deliverables</H2>

### Stage Backdrop

My main idea for the stage backdrop was to lay emphasis on the world renowned Kathak exponent Pandit Birju Maharaj Ji who Garima trained under and carries on the legacy through her academy. The only constrints were the Sponsor Logos.
