## Overview

Sarda Farms is a Dairy that delivers fresh milk & milk products. The app is used to select & purchase products as well as create delivery patterns for recurring deliveries.

## The Current App & Its Problems

The current app has various problems just at first glance:

1. Navigation - The most glaring issue is definitely that there is no back button on any of the screens making it incredibly difficult to exit a flow or go back to the home screen. Navigation items are scattered between a hamburger menu and three dots menu.
