## The Client

This was actually a unique project in that I approached the Srot Foundation and offered to build them a website. I have known one of the directors, Parth Phalke for a couple of years studying under him in an alternative education institution, Sahyadri School, KFI. His passion for education and connecting with students brought him to Himachal in his initiative for Rural Education.

Admittedly, they did have a Wordpress website. However it wasn't fully fleshed out and unfortunately shortly after I reached out, the wordpress setup was hacked and the site went down.
